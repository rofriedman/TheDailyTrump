    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>In announcing that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19,
      President Donald Trump made a series of inaccurate, unsubstantiated or
      misleading statements related to the drug, which remains an unproven
      treatment against the coronavirus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trump said he started taking hydroxychloroquine because he thinks
          “it’s good” and has “heard a lot of good stories.” But there is no published
          data showing that the medication protects against infection with the coronavirus,
          and experts recommend such use only within clinical trials.</li><br><br>
          <li>As part of his justification for taking hydroxychloroquine, the president
            repeatedly said that “many” frontline workers take the drug for COVID-19 prevention.
            It’s unclear how many people do take the drug for prevention, or prophylaxis,
            but several physicians told us they were not aware of the practice at their institutions.</li><br><br>
            <li>Trump insisted that there only has been one “bad survey” of hydroxychloroquine for
              COVID-19. That’s false. Numerous studies, including the best evidence to date,
              do not suggest that hydroxychloroquine is beneficial for COVID-19 patients.</li><br><br>
              <li>The president called an unpublished study that used Veterans Affairs data and found no
                benefit to using hydroxychloroquine “phony” and “false,” and accused the authors of being
                politically motivated. There is no evidence of political bias, and while the study has
                not been peer-reviewed, its results are consistent with other published papers.</li><br><br>
                <li>Trump was also not transparent about the safety risks of hydroxychloroquine, saying
                  “it doesn’t hurt people” and “you’re not going to get sick or die.” While severe side effects
                  of the drug are rare, they have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration.</li><br><br>
                  <li>Trump claimed Rick Bright, former director of the agency charged with overseeing the production
                    and purchase of drugs to counter public health threats, must have been “a believer at one point”
                    in hydroxychloroquine because he “signed the application” for emergency use of the drug. Bright,
                    however, said he did so under pressure and “didn’t have a choice.”</li><br><br>
